# LSOut on the Creation of the GREEN WG
**To**: <Relevant contact points on energy management at ETSI TCEE, ITU-T SG-5, 3GPP SA5…>

**From**: D. Lopez, R. Wilton (GREEN WG chairs), M. Jethanandani (IETF OPS Area Director)

**Subject**: On the creation of the new Getting Ready for Energy-Efficient Networking (GREEN) Working Group (WG) in IETF
 
Dear all,
 
We are glad to inform you of the creation of a new Working Group (WG) in IETF, titled “Getting Ready for Energy-Efficient Networking” (GREEN). The groups creation was recently approved by the IESG and held its first meeting in November 2024, in Dublin, during IETF 121.
 
The GREEN WG is chartered to explore use cases, derive requirements, and provide solutions for identifying and characterizing energy efficiency metrics, methods related to energy consumption of network devices, and optimizing energy efficiency across the network. The WG is committed to focus initially on the following deliverables:
Informational document(s) that (1) defines common terminology and metric definitions, (2) categorizes various types of metrics and measurements at component, device, and network levels.
Definitions of YANG data models at the component level, device level, and network level for energy-efficient network management including energy usage monitoring and energy consumption management.
Informational document(s) that (1) defines a set of architectural components for managing energy-efficient networks and (2) describes incremental deployment considerations for new energy efficiency metrics monitoring and capability discovery, and management within a network domain.
 
The GREEN WG would welcome the opportunity to collaborate with other standard bodies on methods related to power management. As with all IETF WGs, participation is open and most of the discussion happens on the WG list (green@ietf.org) that can be subscribed to at https://mailman3.ietf.org/mailman3/lists/green.ietf.org/.
